      You don't have to be angry, you don't have to be too cool for school. You can just have a good time and dance like no one's watching. Just enjoy life.

    Panic at the Disco has changed their sound repeatedly over the years, usually a different sound for each album. Thanks to this, there's probably at least one song out of their lineup that everybody will love.
